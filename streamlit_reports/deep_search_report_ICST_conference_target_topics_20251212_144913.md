# International Conference on Software Testing (ICST): Overview and Detailed Analysis

## Overview

The International Conference on Software Testing (ICST) serves as a premier forum for researchers and practitioners to present and discuss advancements in software testing, verification, and validation. Its target topics are central to the broader fields of computer science and software engineering, focusing on improving software quality, reliability, and security. Core areas of interest include, but are not limited to, test automation, model-based testing, search-based software testing, security testing, and testing for emerging paradigms like AI/ML systems and cloud-native applications. The conference also emphasizes the practical application of testing techniques in industry, fostering a bridge between theoretical research and real-world engineering challenges. By addressing these critical topics, ICST aims to advance the state of the art in ensuring that software systems behave as intended and are resilient to faults. The evolution of ICST's target topics mirrors broader technological shifts, such as the rise of mobile computing and cloud services, which have introduced new testing challenges and paradigms. This ongoing adaptation ensures the conference remains relevant, addressing contemporary issues like the co-evolution of code and tests, the adoption of continuous integration (CI), coverage analysis, and fuzzing services within modern development workflows. In 2024, the conference (ICST 2024) continues this tradition by inviting high-quality submissions in all areas of software testing, verification, and validation, and will be held in Toronto, Canada from May 27 to May 31. The research track maintains a focus on rigorous, full-length research papers, while the conference program is further enriched by hosting 11 specialized workshops that cover various advanced and niche topics within the software testing domain.
