From the initial stages of digital computing in the 1940s to AI and quantum computing at the vanguard today, tech conferences have followed tech’s course of rapid innovation and major breakthroughs. ## Early Tech Conferences: The Building Blocks of Computing. As personal computers rapidly entered households in the 1980s, they unsurprisingly became the dominant theme of the decade’s tech conferences. The biggest names in personal computers at the time (and now) started hosting conferences of their own: Microsoft’s early developer-focused events, such as PDC (Professional Developers Conference), brought together software engineers eager to learn about the latest in Windows, programming tools, and application development. Following this trend, numerous tech conferences dedicated to the topic, such as the International Conference on Cloud Computing, were established during the middle part of the decade. In response, mobile computing grabbed center stage at many tech conferences.",
